## search_ai_instructors.py

This simple script queries DuckDuckGo to find webpages related to qualified AI course instructors. It requires the `requests` library.

```bash
python3 search_ai_instructors.py "AI \u8ab2\u7a0b \u5408\u683c \u5e2b\u8cc7" -n 5
```

The script will print the top search results.
